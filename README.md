# Franklin-The-Undying

Franklin The Undying was a discord bot created for the 141CR regiment in the game Foxhole. This is the first time I attempted to use discord.py
tp create a discord bot, and as a result, is riddled with bugs. Named after my pet lizard Franklin, the bot added in tools for assigning roles via
message reactions, allowed for easy member acceptance through mass role assignment, played text to speech via a command, and implemented
a member-purge system, where if a user did not check in with the bot within a certain amount of time, they would be purged of all roles 
regarding regimental membership.
